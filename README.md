# StoryStream

StoryStream is an engaging and interactive storytelling game that lets users collaboratively build stories, turn by turn. Players create the beginning of a story, set the turn limit, and then others join in by contributing the next part of the narrative. The most upvoted reply continues the story, making it a community-driven adventure.

At the end of the turn limit, the story is completed and showcased for everyone to enjoy. Compete for upvotes, ranks, and spots on the leaderboard!
